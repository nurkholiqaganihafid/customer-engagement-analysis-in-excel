During this Customer Engagement Analysis in Excel project, you’ll analyze a dataset from the 365 company. It’s important to note that personal user information has been masked to ensure privacy, and the database's volume has been reduced for practical reasons. Nevertheless, you can consider this dataset to accurately represent the company’s operations—providing a realistic and relevant context for your analysis.

In addition, consider the following information about the column values while working with the data:

1. student_id – the unique identifier for each student in the dataset. The field contains IDs for students who used the 365 Data Science platform with free or paid accounts in Q4 2021 (October 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021, both included) and Q4 2022 (October 1, 2022 – December 31, 2022, both included).

2. Paid – indicates whether a student had a paid account during the specified period. It is a binary variable, where '1' represents a paid account and '0' represents a free or unpaid account. It helps differentiate between students who have access to additional features or content through a paid subscription.

3. minutes_watched_21 – represents the student’s engagement level, as expressed by the number of minutes a student has watched in Q4 2021.

4. minutes_watched_22 – denotes the student’s engagement level, as expressed by the number of minutes a student has watched in Q4 2022.

The Excel file consists of four sheets: Task 1 and 2, Task 3, Task 4, and Task 5. Each sheet contains specific information regarding the project's tasks and corresponding data. Use the data in these sheets to answer the questions that follow.
